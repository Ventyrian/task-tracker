# Task Tracker
Allows for the user to add custom tasks to a list and roll a random task to complete. Once the task is completed it will be logged with the date it was completed. The plugin also supports backlogging tasks if enabled.

## Features
- Ability to have three sets of tasks: active, backlog, and completed
- Ability to roll a random task from the set of active tasks
- Ability to set custom repeatable tasks via right clicking a hovered active task
- Completed tasks will have a date associated with it, to keep track of progress
- Ability to configure UI elements such as border color, milestone highlight, date format, and more
- Icons associated with keywords will be displayed next to the current task

Keywords include: *Quest* or the *Quest Name*, *Kill* or *Slayer*, *Level*, *exp*, or any *skill name*, *Obtain*, *Diary*, and *Buy*

These are not case sensitive and some have priority over others
